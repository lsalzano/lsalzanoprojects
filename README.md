# lsalzanoprojects
This is a repository containing my university projects.
There is a project in Python implementing the classic minefield game,
a project in C# on chess openings taking data from a Kaggle database,
an implementation in Matlab of a Lasserre formula for numerical integration 
on the simplex and a project on fractal geometry in Wolfram Mathematica.
